VoiceIdentifier
===============

Program using Machine Learning techniques to correctly determine the identity of a person speaking from an audio sample.

## Getting Started ##

To get started, clone the repository into your workspace. 

In eclipse, create a new project called "VoiceIdentifier." You may need to uncheck "Default Location" and select the correct folder, depending on how you have it set up. 

Also, I personally prefer spaces over tabs for various reasons. Make sure you make the changes here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/407929/how-do-i-change-eclipse-to-use-spaces-instead-of-tabs

If you have any questions about using Git, let me know. There are a lot of good guides online.
